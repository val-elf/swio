# Welcome to StarWars Inquiry Office!

We glad to represent you unique project.
This is a StarWars Universe inquire office, the most complete library of the inhabited worlds.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.6, and this is true.

## Development server
If you want to develop our project and improve (but, it could be difficult, we must warning you), you can use next helpful information.
Run `ng serve` for a dev server, and you will be pleasure surprise! Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files, by mystical way.

And, enjoy!

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`. Who would have thought? But it works, yeap.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md). But, we hope, you don't have to do that.
